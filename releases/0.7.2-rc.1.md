# GrimoireLab 0.7.2-rc.1
The following list describes the changes by component:



## sortinghat 0.8.0-rc.4 - (2023-01-10)

**Breaking changes:**

 * SortingHat as a service\
   SortingHat started as a command line tool but, after some years, we
   saw its potential and we decided to create a new version of it. Now,
   it works as an individual service.  This new version provides a new
   GraphQL API to operate with the server and a UI web-based app, that
   replaces Hatstall, the old UI for SortingHat.  Moreover, the new
   version adds some features requested long time ago, such as
   groups/teams management, recommendations of affiliations and
   individuals, or a totally renwed user interface.
